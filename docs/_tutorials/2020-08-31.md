## review writing/outlining

* problem: if I don't feel good about a simpler word use a more technical one
* extra parens -> more cluttered
* trying to hard to copy what the paper says (outlining) instead of explaining the ideas
* idea: maybe should have added commentary at the end of each subsection.
* copying the parts i didn't like is confusing -- ppl might as well just read the original.

* ET: what are important ideas, only write about those, not redo the rest, give self more leeway to reorganise it, alter the presentation, use own examples, etc.
* todo: write alt version - not outlining; explain it myself.

## advance and answer method

* example: <http://curi.us/1595#12793>
* the post is in two parts - one advance, one answer

## exercises

* tree-out http://curi.us/1595#12793 discussion
* analyse first level replies: https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ze6PqJK2jnwnhcpnb/chains-bottlenecks-and-optimization
* and other material from http://curi.us/2371-analyzing-quotes-objectively-and-socially
* work on checklist and improve, check "social dynamics summary notes"

## social dynamics

* effort-based analysis
  * who's putting in how much effort?
  * who's asking for how much effort?
  * who's reacting to who
  * who gets to question who?
  * who answers?
  * who ignores counter-party requests?
  * who gives hints and expects the counter-party to figure out what he means
  * who's happy with status quo, who want's change, who's needy?
  * calm is high status
  * LoLE
  * who's framing of the issue dominates?
  * who's signalling expertise?

* social thing: okay to lie to prevent people being discouraged
