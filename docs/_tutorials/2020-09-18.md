## tutorial notes

* sentence 1, generic statement that a lot of ppl claim. ppl filter it out.
  * ppl misinterpret by thinking "most forums" is like bottom 50%
  * doesn't give them important actiontionable ppl
* > Itâ€™s rude to criticise someone
  * not point of difference for most ppl, e.g. lesswrong
* > You have to stay on topic
  * ppl think staying on topic is a good thing, accusation against other forums
* (maybe) need to focus on some point of difference that is more evident or something
* ppl don't know how FI is different
  * topic: every conversation is *unbounded*

* on note of philosophy in life, Rand's *philosophy who needs it* chapters 1 and 2

* one thing I notice is I can tell pretty quickly is when I've fooled myself with the quality of what I write. I *didn't* do proper structure and brainstorming before writing *Hello, and welcome to FI*. I thought I had done enough but it falls down really quickly. I have a bad intuition
