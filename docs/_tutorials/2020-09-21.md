1. TOC
{:toc}

> holding back b/c improving

ongoing problem -- maybe forever problem. not a problem that goes away

- comparative advantage between work stuff and public FI stuff

plan for ongoing learning curve; whatever I make in next year can be done better in 5 years

## re flux and goals 26min

- wholistic: in terms of world, leverage points, etc. best path doesn't need to be direct.

**todo**: write about this

## speedrunning 38min

* repetitive stuff -> automatic -> can learn and think at the same time

* persistence - debugging 49min

## reach - patio 59 min

## overreaching

- error rate
- not managing / exceeding
- persistent and not able to solve a problem
- has to do with the process by which you encounter problems and attitude with solving them / approach to solving them

ET: error rate > error correction rate

What errors exist/possible depend on your goal.

Can still make errors like doing bad exploration (or wrong area of study, maybe), get bad overview.

more meta goal: test out exploring, gauge effectiveness -- can do that even if full exploration is beyond you atm

- can go meta to do this

Some things are probably beyond you anyway, so better to leave alone till you have more basics / foundations down.

There are some ways to engage with end goal near the beginning, can get some info

"going meta" changes the goal of the *activity* to a different ~level of emergence, sorta. like "build planes" can become "go to work with a guy who builds planes and see if you like it"

- motivation for OR stuff
  - having discussions, someone makes 1 or 2 errors
    - you talk about those
      - they respond with 1 or 2 more errors
        - etc
  - never get back to original topic b/c they're not resolving errors
    - economics stuff

84min autopilot means you can work on problems like *tilt* much more easily b/c you can *isolate* it. not as easy to work on tilt in social situations, for example, b/c there's lots more factors.

sort of like minimal test case; fewer extraneous details. overlapping ~minimal cases help to; allows for better isolation.

- 89 min; inverse yesno / bifurcation / goals / something

big part of OR: not enough consideration of prereqs or planning

- what's the plan
- what's it require
- do I expect to succeed
- can't achieve anything to
- some goals beyond resources (including skills, time, ppl to help you), not just money and land and whatever
- any prereq is a resource; trying to get some knowledge
  - any requirement for making the project work is a resource
- fully explore what's required to make the project work, then compare to what you have available
- doing to much can lower both success rate + abs(output)
  - sometimes you could add resources (e.g. buy another computer)
  - but being over capacity in other areas is overall harmful to output
- ppl sometimes start projects that have prereqs that take years (e.g. physics degree)

### similar projects to grammar stuff

- learning from some kinda course work - learn from text
- reading things and sentence analysis
- using a dictionary to figure out what something means
- jigsaw puzzles / shapes together
- complex / modular from simple things
- classification of things and general relationships
- breaking down into subproblems
- learning to automate classification to allow more complex constructions

from ET

- multi day
- talk with ppl
- share work
- self judge/mark
- learn from videos
- learn from tutor

#### how was grammar diff to things I've done before

* grammar
* streamed?

want as few different things as possible

if lots of different things, do projects that only do a few differences, build up to large project

if something goes wrong in small project, you can isolate and work on the problem

ET: like small games -> easy to master

If you don't do small things you can be fooled by like the *union* of problems -> has a lower ceiling than the actual space of results do.

### max and Blockchain 

- written like 4 micro-minimal chains
  
### OR

Sign of OR: if you can't break down into parts

another sign: surprise

children start out pretty okay (they don't try to exceed capacities, don't want to); pushed into overreaching via social pressure

- doesn't give you space to get ahead

better to aim for being under capacity because variance makes things unpredictable

- spare capacity?
  - flex projects
- only schedule resources for like 2/3 capacity for mandatory things
  - rest is flex stuff, can drop to increase capacity for mandatory things
  - examples: money/budget or scheduling during waking hours (or work hours)

----

for next time:

writing about goals, life plan, big picture

- prerequisites, resources used for diff things
- understanding of success criteria
- ppl sometimes jump into projects before knowing the success criteria and goals
  - doesn't work for hard things
  - can get some benefits with hard things, but less efficient
