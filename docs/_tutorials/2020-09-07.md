##

* need good way to organise async discussions
  * important: linear view
    * nested comments -> button to show chronology
* depends in large part on being good at having discussions
  * policies help
    * easy to not follow own policies
* reading stuff - listening easier to get started
  * getting started important
  * listening effort efficient
    * can do a second reading (visually) for good stuff
    * can read more books than if only doing it visually
    * pausing good to do occasionally
  * perfectionism a common problem

## 36, 37, 38

taking stock, goals, next sessions

* [40 min] there are options about how we might do a discussion
* having discussions and running into issues can be a good way to bring issues to light
  * are there problems I already know about?
* ET: looking back at all tutes: 55min
  * what's worked well
    * not getting stuck - flexible topics and things
    * discussing tricky stuff
    * broader knowledge -> more informed decisions
  * what's worked less well
    * F: early on - emotional conflicts w/ self
    * pressure to do stuff / write / hw / whatever
  * what do I need more practice on
    * discussion
    * ???
  * and overall perspective.
  * ET: part has been going through quickly so I can practice on my own
    * what things?

## future ideas:

* how to use trees for debates in yes/no way, use decisive arguments, mark branch as resolved.
  * e.g. can mark nodes that are meant to be decisive
    * some commentary can be good/useful
    * would be good to do in general
* long term schedule

* set goals at waking up
  * check again every 4hrs

* writing stuff about fi [83 min]
  * remind self of things
