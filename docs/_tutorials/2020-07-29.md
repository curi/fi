finite verb needs a subject
- explain doesn't have a subject
- finite verb: action actually happening
- not an explain action in "i can explain"
- second way (explain I can) is conceptually nice but not grammatically accurate structure wise
- finite vs non-finite not particularly well covered - wiki has some good grammar stuff

## I can explain the acronyms if need be

```
can
    i
    explain
        acronyms
            the
```

non-finite verbs can play a noun role (has to be gerund or infinitive)

verbal: means nonfinite verb

infinitives don't need 'to' - if a verbal isn't a gerund but is playing a noun role it must be an infinitive

what thing is doing what action at a specified point in time

a finite verb is bounded (not partial)

the nonfinite verb has some unbound aspect/parameter. often this relates to the timing, but can have subject (uncommon) or object (common) too

"need be" as verb + auxverb can't be under 'if' as preposition

need could be an infinitive - but where does 'be' go

be -> synonym for exists -> 'need exists' -> ....

be - present subjunctive

ET: learn faster by focusing on simpler cases

error: `if` as preposition -> more practice to become automatic
