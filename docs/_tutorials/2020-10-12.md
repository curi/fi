note: not feeling so hot today

## reflection

- not quite sure how to do more re: bigger picture goals, just more detailed?
- I feel like i'm regressing maybe, like focusing more on other things again means I'm getting lazy

## Goals

- Write docs about IBDD (Flux) -- technical / systems level writing
- Get better at writing
  - I don't feel like I've done enough
  - quality isn't high enough
  - not 'easy' enough in general (it is somewhat easy when I'm 'inspired')
- Reading habit not instantiated
- Improving my discussion capability
  - quality
  - I want to be able to effectively *lead* a discussion

Note: I started doing this and felt a bit flat so worked on the post below a bit.

## tutorial

### spaced repetition

- ET: should probs do spaced repetition practice of past exercises
  - e.g. brainstorming before writing
  - writing practice
    - topic sentences
  - grammar trees / analysis
  - text analysis trees
    - connections between ideas, how they relate to each other
    - analysis for social dynamics
  - trees in general; debate tree, brainstorming tree
  - philosophy:
    - yes/no -- go through content
    - paths forward -- review at least
      - articles
    - overreaching
    - scheduling / resource budgets / buffers / procrastination / motivation

not just maintenance, none of these are "done"

- urgency; no pressure -> no work
  - FI: it is urgent (compounding effect)
    - allocate time?
    - mindset shift
      - think this has something to do with some general dissatisfaction w/ myself / some conflict.
  - you have to see a problem to be motivated to solve it / work on it
    - e.g. parents with some problem might be motivated to discuss / learn about TCS
    - throughout day - come up with examples of where some skill would be helpful
      - identify specific times
      - planning steps help to see problems more clearly: goal, resource usage, budget; list things that would help make the project better / more successful
        - "wishful thinking" list
  - buffers - over-scheduling
    - schedule too full -> pushing things off
    - if schedule is 'semi open' then it's easier to fit in FI / reading / etc
    - scheduling waking hours vs 'office hours'
    - flex time
      - the goal: flex time not wasted time
    - don't be afraid to have extra flex time
      - my guess is probably 50% is a good place to start
    - good use of flex time: taking stock of situation, looking at schedule docs, estimating buffers, will I have spare time or not, etc

writing practice

- can practice philosophy stuff by writing about it
  - repeatedly writing posts helps think through and 'internalize' the idea

reading -- practice and *make habitual*.

- Justing + Anne's conversation about Atlas Shrugged helped

### leading discussions

- objective part
  - discussion tree
  - work with them in collab way to brainstorm issues and questions and address systematically
    - some nodes we'll agree on
    - disagreement nodes are where discussion & reasons happen
      - can make arguments that aren't decisive but sound good
        - other person might be persuaded
        - makes sense particularly when person does believe in arguments of support
      - better is to find decisive issues
        - both ppl could suggest an idea which, if it were wrong, they would change their mind
        - lots of issues disagreed about, but not all will change their mind
          - good explicit upfront question
          - what's the crucial thing that would change my mind
        - often there's a key issue in both ppl's mind
        - one way to get at it via goldratt's conflict clouds / evaporating clouds
        -
- social part
  - issues like do they want to listen / respond
  - manage social stuff at least some

- writing checklist
  - 95 min

carryover:

- idea for post (for max):
  - how should one respond to impasses
  - why is discussion methodology important
