- object/complement patterns
  - can look up / memorise linking verbs

# motivation and things

- when ppl don't do things with no obvious reason (emotions/motivation)
  - not fully persuaded
    - conflicted
    - criticisms, doubts, objections (in your mind)

- part: frustrated / not doing what I value

- the avoidance behaviour (e.g. social events over reading books)
  - reasons I like the social events, not fully refuted so don't try avoiding them

- consume less mental energy -> rested
  - do it tired
- find video games more
  - often go back to old ones
  - easier / familiar
  - easier to do tired
  - liked for reasons like reward cycles / (pve wow + bethesda)
  - do better different
- reward cycles
  - common misconceptions
    - defer to authority - approval by teacher type thing
      - ppl not used to setting goals, game gives you goals
        - easier / thoughtless too
        - collectables, level ups, sounds, choose stats ritual, etc
        - games provide indirection: get to lvl 60 before this area is unlocked
      - ppl not confident in setting own goals
        - effortful
        - compete against ppl on same goals, make comparisons (all playing a diff game)
        - std goals allows syncing up between players
        - *why would these goals appeal more than my goals?*
          - my goals unclear to me?

criticism of bad things is not thourough enough

things ppl think are good not fully convinced

- e.g. reading not always good
  - not getting enough value out of that
  - *their* type of reading not always good
    - if they were better they might do more, or at least know more about whether they do like it or not
  - ppl have misconceptions, e.g. of what intellectuals do
    - e.g. over-rational prediction of what life would be like
    - which they don't really want

- categories
  - might like things instead of FI
  - critcisms that aren't thorough enough
  - FI work not productive enough
    - not doing in best ways?
  - doubts/objections
    - e.g. will it lead to a big difference

- overestimation of capacity
  - best case vs average case, no buffer etc
  - not accounting being tired, just raw time
  - transition time, overhead

- burnout testable
  - break + sleep + see if feel better
    - burnout -> should be able to manage life in better way
      - could build up slowly
      - how to deal with over-engagement?
      - find limits via overly-conservative

- if prob is burnout, shouldn't be super hard to find long-term soln
  - err on low side
    - tune it up gradually
  - variety of activity including easier ones
    - use different resources
    - small amount of "high output" hours per day
  
- imbalance between mental/physical means excess capacity you could use
  - efficiency
  - how quickly you get tired -> how hard -> quality and practice of prerequisites
    - foundation makes that better
      - conflicts on belief on foundations?
    - FI has lots of unique/diverse skills (different from my BG for example)

- early warning signs
  - document and learn to listen to them
- avoiding working on some issues because stuck is more specific than doing things because of tiredness which is more general

evasion: after break, do they go back to something else or something different?
    returning to topic: indication the problem

disappointed in self
- desired to see self as X / be seen as X
  - social: threatening to lose status
  - conflict
- clash between reasonable expectations and actual case
- recalibrate expectations (what you're able to do, etc)
- could just lower
  - but coming up with explanatory understanding -> higher direction / specific fixes / etc

daily energy budgets
- reducing overhead important
- practice increases budgets in relevant areas (like exercise and physical currency)
  - potential compound wrt learning
- cheapening activities - no limit?
  - doing something according to misconception
    - goal of reading a book is not to read all the words, but to understand concpets (well with some books)
      - outlines / search / etc
- using budget more efficiently - what's your ACTUAL maximum budget
  - understanding regen
  - rest activities (nap, random tv/chill, music, etc)

overhead:

- whats normal?
  - if not standard, high priority, [usually] achievable (b/c not normal)
- inefficiency comes from errors (sometimes irrational; like misconceptions when starting a project)
  - that's higher priority
- bigger issue: commitments and time mgmt / limits

WRT big picture change: piecemeal change

overestimation of impact of new knowledge

splitting activities?
