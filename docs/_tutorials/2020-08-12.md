## Notes on [homework](../2020-08-11-homework)

### on max's summary at start

- goal isn't trivial if it includes audience

- why do ppl swim
  - 'people swim for lots of reasons' - better to omit this sentence
  - 'voluntary' sentence doesn't add much
  - 'concrete sides of a pool' largely irrelevant to 'why do people swim'
- tides

tides argument breakdown:

- moon pulls on water
- some water is pulled more than other water
- the water that is pulled the most changes as the moon orbits the earth spins
- the sun works similarly to the moon but weaker


- aimless writing due in part to not picking problems that are relatable.

timestamp: 00:39:00

- big complex ideas are tricky to share
  - better to unpack into components
  - what chunks can people understand at once time? (that's a sentence)


shoes contrast:

- (Max) These kinds of shoes might not make life easier for the wearer, and even cause them pain or deform the foot over long periods of consistent wear.
  - talking about making life easier; point about pain auxiliary
- (Elliot) People care enough about fashion to wear shoes that actually hurt their feet.
  - want to indicate fashion prioritised over utility

conflict between idea of structuring things well and having a full idea in your head and trying to get it all out at once.

**fix issues with sessions 1-3**

- pick relevant problems; ones I care about more
- keep goal of the *exercise* in mind

## exercises during tutorial

### how to use a microwave

Microwaves can be used to heat up food and liquids. If your food is frozen you will need to put it in for longer.

You need to make sure there isn't any metal (like foil, or spoons) with the food you're going to put in there. If there's metal in the microwave while it's on it will spark.

You use the microwave by putting your food (inside a container or on a plate) in the microwave. Then you close the door and choose settings like power level and time. When you're done you press the "go" button.

The microwave should now make a buzzing sound while the timer counts down. When it's done the microwave will go "bing" (or make some other sound) and your food will be hot -- if you left it in there for long enough. Be careful though, it might be so hot that it burns you. It's good to let it cool down before you eat it.

### brainstorming solns: microwave broke: how do I cook dinner

- fix microwave (might be possible if like the door got jammed)
- use alternate heat source you'd typically find in a kitchen
  - stove top with a pan
  - oven
- eat cold dinner (like salad)
- eat at a restaurant or get take out (someone else cooks for you)
- ask your neighbour if you can borrow their microwave (take your food there)
- collect fire wood and start a small fire (preferably outside)
  - (not a sub-point) have breakfast instead (derivative: cold dinner)
- eat something that doesn't require preparation, like fruit or leftovers

### brainstorming: brainstorming topics

- a thing you have which you reply on breaks, what do?
- what to do when you're sad?
- how to do brainstorming
- why is it good to brainstorm before writing things down in sentences and paragraphs?
- how do I solve a problem I have?
- how can we generate infinite numbers of derivative ideas from a single starting point?
- where did the universe come from?
- how do alpacas communicate
- how do you teach a dog to play the piano (like a small one with ~7 keys)
- (getting out of the way) can you write music in text and play it through midi things
- how do you compress video?
- why should I care about brainstorming?
- how do you get your mind to not think about meta things when it keeps thinking about meta things?
- how do you get songs out of your head?
- how to tell if your ideas are good
- how to convince other ppl they are
- figuring out why a project failed
- figuring out how you could avoid that a failure

### brainstorming: getting a date with a stripper

- presumably we're not talking about just paying her
- so you need to convince her to go on a date with you
  - why would she want to?
    - she wants to feel good about herself?
    - she wants something other than sex from a relationship? (like presumably that's in surplus)
      - so you could like appeal to that?
      - how to do that so you don't come off as lame
      - is this something she actually wants?
    - you could convince her that you'll love and cherish her forever and have lots of money and things
  - you could intimidate her into going on a date
  - you could just try and pay her - even though i said above that was excluded
    - she might?
  - you could like just ask her too, without trying the above
- step back
  - research strippers - since that's a defining characteristic, why do they do that? what do they get out of it? are there any dominant themes you could play to?
  - research who strippers don't date.
  - once you know more about strippers in general you can learn about all the strippers close to you
    - you probably want to pick one you like anyway
    - more strippers means more chances one will say yes
    - but you don't want to just ask them all in a bunch, you want to figure out how to make the best one say yes to a date (well, that's not explicitly part of the goal)
  - learn about women in general, too (presuming you're going after a female stripper)
    - maybe male strippers are easier dates? could work
    - but things that work in general for women are likely to work for female strippers
- attract her

### budgeting

budgeting is managing your money which means knowing how much you're earning and how much you're spending (and on what). The point of budgeting is - in the sort term - to avoid being broke and to make sure you save a bit. The long term point of budgeting is to build up a significant amount of wealth so you don't have to spend as much time working or doing things you don't want to -- financial freedom.

Lots of ways to do budgeting have been developed by people, but they rely on the same foundations. There are specialised software or books to help with budgeting if you don't want to make spreadsheets from scratch. These are good if you don't have much experience with budgeting because they give you a well-tested framework to start with. Over time you can adjust and customise how you budget to better suit your lifestyle.

if your goal is long term financial freedom it's important to understand the theoretical side of how saving money works. For example: did you know that the time it will take you to retire is directly proportional to the proportion of income you save? This is because you only need to survive on the income you don't save. If you live on less income you don't need as much money to generate passive income enough to completely replace income from labour.

If your goal is to avoid being broke every month and not live pay cheque to pay cheque then you don't need to worry about that now. You should focus instead on "balancing" your budget: making sure you know how much you're going to spend ahead of time and that you don't overspend. That way you can start to build up a safety net. After that you can worry about the long term stuff.
