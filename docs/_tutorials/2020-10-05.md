## romance novels (X - 18min)

general comments

## quality of conversation

- how to have higher qual discussions with ppl other than ET
  - ET:
    - conversation tree, review before replying, share with other person, consider what is a reply to what, esp important for self
    - short chunks
      - 2 at a time technique (ask a quest, answer one of theirs)
    - comments and aside stuff doesn't need to go in tree
    - focus -> going in to depth -> focus on goal of getting something resolved
      - metric for conversation: resolutions (like OKRs / Key Outcomes)
  - pre-empt hostility to discussion methodology with 'rules' esq post?
  - people feel like they're 'done' with learning about having discussions
  - ppl want to 'win'
    - setting bad victory conditions
    - student-teacher relationship vs peer-peer
- MK: try conversation tree next time
  - idea: is that how a forum could be structured

- winning at fi
  - no way to let them win
  - feeling of winning /= actually winning?

- asymmetry
  - rationality symmetric -- 'impartial' maybe better word

- conversation 'phases'
  - early game: common ground, inferential difference
  - mid game?
  - end game?

ppl expect *most* conversations to fail; they're looking for partial value to extract not proper outcomes.

people have a 'queue' of problems so they don't like other errors being brought up
