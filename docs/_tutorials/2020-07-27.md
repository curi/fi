Grammar:

* gone through initial 3 videos
* read some of the PDFs
* going through Rithmatist (ep1 nearly done)

Qs:

* Is there anything particular I should be looking to get out of the grammar material?
  * feels similar to what we've already been doing
  * a bit boring - is that an issue? should it be?
  * I'm a bit unsure / unfocused

Point of doing grammar work:

* double check material / reviewing / is it autopilot enough?
* how to transition from building blocks to structures
  * grammar -> text analysis
