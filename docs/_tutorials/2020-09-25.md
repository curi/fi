1. TOC
{:toc}

rand
-> 'too early for pol party'
-> ppl need better ideas, first
-> after that worry about pol party.

invisalign -> look into technology; risks or whatever; papers

## My Goals - bigger stuff

-- last updated 2018

1. (parallel)
    a. make a bunch of money (~~$5-10m~~ $20m? for family/life/future; rest for mission & purpose)
    b. develop Flux / IBDD in b.g. -> Work towards new BoI for Democracy
2. Funnel money into Flux -> get it stable
3. T+ ~5yrs: start process of finding suitable partner (other things can be ongoing)
4. T+ ~10yrs: child (partner needs to learn TCS + Philosophy gaps)
    - ideally the other projects are stable enough to not need my active involvement.

### notes from tutorial

* Things that need doing
    * Better Democracy
    * Not shit education
        - > anti-social
        - > anti-dishonesty
    * Social Dynamics too powerful for most ppl
    *

* Break{points,throughs}
    * intellectual breakthrough
    * plan for leverage points / use
    * being right isn't enough
    * model world -> exploit constraint
        * it's not luck

big improvements
    -> forces at work
    -> suppress change
    -> e.g. ruling elites

elections
    -> in general bad

educate many ppl or powerful ppl
    -> can you do both?

rand -> couldn't find anyone?
     -> ??
     -> who trains the ordinary ppl so great ppl have followers?

rand
- wrote books
    - not *for* the masses, just works okay for them
    - designed? to be super good for super good ppl

massive longitudinal shortage of philosophers.

great ppl (e.g. goldratt / feynmann)
    - middling parents b/c static memes

failure of ppl to use TOC:
    - fragile knowledge

not see it coming:
    - super high quality low cost education
