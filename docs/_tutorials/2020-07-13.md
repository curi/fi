# Tutorial 13

## the choice

### relating to *it's not luck*

re complexity: 

brainstorm -> cause effect find causes, maybe intermediaries -> find nexus in tree

## yes/no (12m)

1595 - variety of things predatings BoI

rejecting gradations of certainty 2016

1589

1581 - epist without weights

## fi - discussions and how to take non-responses (15m)

dangerous to presume low error rate in non-replied posts

* why no reply diff question to OP
* self-reply 3+ days

pick a single topic and discuss to conclusion

if getting stuck:

* can ask for suggestions
* pausing discussion - problem is not following through, easy to start new discussions

## grammar (23m)

- keep practice up
- peikoff course has homework exercises
- curi gumroad grammar course

## text analysis (28m)

> Artificial intelligence is an existence proof of one of the great ideas in human history: that the abstract realm of knowledge, reason, and purpose does not consist of an élan vital or immaterial soul or miraculous powers of neural tissue.

AI is <existence proof> of a great idea: the non-supernatural mind.

[The idea of the existence of AGI proves the mind is [not wholly?] supernatural [but doesn't exclude it]]

> Rather, it can be linked to the physical realm of animals and machines via the concepts of information, computation, and control.

it: candidate:
- AI
- !! existence proof
- !! one of the great ideas in human history [that the abstract realm of knowledge, reason, and purpose [does not consist of]]
- the abstract realm of knowledge, reason, and purpose

[to some degree AGI is based in physical realm: info systems / computations.]
[to some degree <that realm> is based in physical realm: info systems / computations.]

> Knowledge can be explained as patterns in matter or energy that stand in systematic relations with states of the world, with mathematical and logical truths, and with one another.

{Knowledge can be <explained as patterns in matter or energy>} {[and those patterns] stand <in systematic relations> <with states of the world>, <with mathematical and logical truths>, <and with one another>}.

Knowledge can be explained as patterns
Those patterns are of matter or energy
Those patterns stand in systematic relations with: states of the world
Those patterns stand in systematic relations with: mathematical and logical truths
Those patterns stand in systematic relations with: one another.

[knowledge [is] patterns. those patterns stand:
    * in relations to states of world
    * with truths
    * with one another]

knowledge:

* instantiation in reality / physics
  * 
* relationships to:
  * states of the world
  * maths + logic
  * consistent with "one another" (referring to patterns?)

(grammar tree up to 88 minutes)

## returning to paragraph (93 min)

> Reasoning can be explained as transformations of that knowledge by physical operations that are designed to preserve those relations. 

> Purpose can be explained as the control of operations to effect changes in the world, guided by discrepancies between its current state and a goal state.

Purpose is about making or preventing changes to the world based on our ideas and goals.

> Naturally evolved brains are just the most familiar systems that achieve intelligence through information, computation, and control.

- are there artificially evolved brains

> Humanly designed systems that achieve intelligence vindicate the notion that information processing is sufficient to explain it—the notion that the late Jerry Fodor dubbed the computational theory of mind.

### discussion structures 89min

* estimate of discussion structure
  * both ppl estimate complexity of discussion

## ET's email 110 min

* philosophy who needs it : ctrl-f elephant; ppl who write like pinker
  * fancy ideas - self blame when they don't understand
