## what's the differences between statements where you change the focus from occurrence to prevalence
what is the difference between

> TS occurs in people from all ethnic groups; males are affected about three to four times more often than females.

and

> TS patients are disproportionately male (at a ratio of 3:1); no ethnic group is disproportionately represented [in TS patients].

## What are the right changes to make if you want to change the world?

from <https://curi.us/1994-goals-and-status-update>

> Most people trying to change the world skip the step where they put a massive amount of effort into figuring out which are the right changes. I've done that step. I will debate anyone on the matter, but it's hard to find anyone willing to discuss it much.

one thing that occurs to me is that one's *comparative advantage* matters.
the best thing for you to do might not be the best thing for me to do, etc.

## On free will and MWI

the main idea to explore is about whether the belief in some sort of free-will-esq thing matters for the particular histories we end up in

like more future histories of mine are good when I think I have self-determination regardless of the laws of physics (particularly what they say about determinism)

like more future histories of mine are good when I think I have self-determination because of the laws of physics (what they say about how my brain works and how ideas will change the world)

## Early Learning: Objectivism

1. I know about it (Objectivism) in name only (and only since learning about FI, and because of FI)
2. google: "define:objectivism" - 2. [Philosophy] the belief that certain things, especially moral truths, exist independently of human knowledge or perception of them.
3. wiki/objectivism: Rand described Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".

thoughts:

* sounds super compatible with ideas re objective morality in BoI

## Evolution selected for "depression"

The thing ppl commonly call 'depression' was evolutionarily selected for - it *helped* humans.
