- good things
  - he's hedging with "probably a bad idea" in the title -- not anymore? changed?
  - they are good criticisms of many evoting systems *in use*

- things might have changed
  - yes they have

- anonymity and trust

- secret ballot
  - italian attack
- voters need to be able to trust their vote will be counted
- corrupt, threatened, incompetent
  - all 3 apply to paper voting
  - there are better methods to deal with all 3 for online voting
- 2min "physical voting" - he means paper; in the prev video he argued mostly against evoting machines (which are physical)
- evoting machines
  - trusting software and the hardware
    - software - "probably" closed source
    - moving the problem - BS argument, we have reasonable breakpoints for this stuff
- 4:55 - DEFCON's hack the vote is not an argument that has *anything* to do with *the best* methods for online voting
  - cmon, get serious
- 6:00 - understand and implicitly trust, don't think we can do that with paper voting.
- 6:20 - MITM - we can solve that completely; "are more difficult" is true like "your guess of a random number between 0 and 2^256 *might* be right". Sure, just don't expect it to happen in any time in your lifetime (or the lifetime of the universe).
- 6:35 - don't need a server
- re e-voting machines: why not use the same solution as we have for paper voting? scrutineers? The parts that aren't practical to scrutineer can be done via public methods.
- user error - bad example (excel), we have stuff to do that for us, doing it in excel is not excusable, but that's not an issue with online voting, it's an issue with *process*. An electoral commission making a mistake like that is egregious. A better argument is: why should we *ever* trust an EC which makes that kind of mistake? Kick everyone out who had anything to do with that process unless there's evidence they tried to raise the issue and were shut down. Hire *competent* people. They exist.
- why should we use voting machines with (exposed) USB connections?
- phone or computer; voting from home
  - malware, that's BS; we know how to avoid that. App stores can be like "your phone isn't supported" and you don't use it.
  - then he cites russia ATTACKING A PAPER ELECTION

- 9:45 blockchain
  - trying to explain
  - "weird technology" - social signals, dishonest, not technical arguments
  - basically write-only DB; no, though that is a part of it.
    - important key features: immutable, censorship resistant, everyone has the same view (verifiably so), and (can be, not always) anonymous
    - still need integrity from voter->DB, but we can do that
