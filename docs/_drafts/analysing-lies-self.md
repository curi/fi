analysing lies - self

why people should pay attention to what i say

- they say i'm smart
- i say things about the world or what they should do
- they do different things
- wtf

what does this say about my expectations for how other people think?

what does it mean for how I should think about some other peoples opinions?

if they know more than me about X I should listen?

who knows more than me about what?
