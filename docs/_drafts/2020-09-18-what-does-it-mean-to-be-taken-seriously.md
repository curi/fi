- ppl ~believe you
  - or at least they believe that your opinion carries 'weight'
    - i.e. if you think something is a big deal but it's not intuitive/obvious to them, they'll be predisposed to listen
  - it means they pay attention and consider things you say more carefully than they do for other ppl
- it means they think you have the reputation/track record to back up the idea
- the ythink you've done DD
- their mental model of you includes things they might not be able to do
  - they take you at your word
  - they accept using your ideas as a shortcut, or that there are ideas they don't know / understand yet

what don't they do?

- dismiss you/your ideas
- ignore you/your ideas
- condescend / be mean
- ignore your preferences
