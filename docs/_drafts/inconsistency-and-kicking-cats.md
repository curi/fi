# the nature of inconsistency and people's intention.

let's say I claim google doesn't care about dart.

max:
>google doesn't care about dart.

dartguy:
>yeah they do, you don't go making a language without caring about it. they have design goals and like people working on it full time and all this good stuff.

max:
>that doesn't matter, it's not how much one does to *achieve* an outcome that shows how much they care about it.
it's the things that they *don't* do, or things they do which *harm* the thing itself.
maybe it's only like harm at arms length - that could look like lack of resources or things.
it's not that they're *deliberately* trying to harm the thing, just that their lack of dedication -- the things they're *not* doing -- is what shows how little they care.

dartguy:
>I don't buy it, gimme a concrete example.

max:
> okay. say there's a person sally who has a cat. she say's she loves cats. but she kicks her cat sometimes. maybe it's in the way or whatever.
do you think she really loves cats?

dartguy:
> no, she's like faking or something.

max:
> yeah, so that's what google's doing. it took them a year (or more) to get non-nullable in to production.
literally a small team of people 12 months to get a basic feature like *making sure variables can't be null* (which, btw, is something you mostly have to introduce at some point).
good luck waiting for like a better type system or better support for pure functional stuff or whatever.
dart isn't a language that can grow faster than the demand for features grows.
google ppl are smart, they know they either need to put resources in one day or it'll die.
so what does this mean google are doing? they're hedging their bets.
they're not willing to put like a decent sized team on the project or get ppl to rewrite the language while they still can to avoid BS like taking 12 months to get non-nullable working.
if google really cared they wouldn't hedge their bets like this.
they wouldn't leave out features like the initial publication of a package being straight to a verified publisher's page instead of via some random personal acct first.
they wouldn't have tolerated a foundation so bad they needed 12 months to make sure stuff wasn't `null`.
dart would have better foundations if they wanted something to last.
it's a short term play, and it shows.
