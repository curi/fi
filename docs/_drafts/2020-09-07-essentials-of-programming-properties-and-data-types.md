# properties and data types

Good code is "well behaved".
I think this means code should be predictable, portable, and profitable.
It should do exactly what we expect it to, in any and all conditions, and it should add value.
Programming is more productive and enjoyable when we depend on well behaved code, and it's unproductive and frustrating when we depend on badly behaved code.

A necessary part of coding is designing data types.
Well defined data types make for a better coding experience, and a better end product, too.
They allow you (the programmer) to work at a higher level of abstraction, which lets you build better programs, and build more of them.
Even if you don't build more, you can build the ones you want to in less time.
