# To: FI Beginners

This article is for anyone coming to FI for the first time, or returning from a hiatus. I'm writing it because I think more content can help make joining FI long-term an easier process. It will never be easy; if it were it'd be worthless.

You won't fit in. That's okay, though, "fitting in" doesn't matter.

FI isn't hostile to beginners. It's hostile to *overreaching*.
