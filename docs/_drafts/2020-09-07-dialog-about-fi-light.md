dialog - is there a case for #fi-lite (like a lower standards channel)

max: I think there's a good case, take these general benefits: place for beginners to take part with lower standards; sets up an idea of progression; allows for more incremental learning; and it means participating isn't binary - allows people to stay connected with the community somewhat w/o completely leaving.

anon: what's your goal w/ #fi-lite?

max: Learning FI is hard. I think making it easier will help FI grow and that would be good. I want to see FI succeed.

anon: sounds like you want to get more ppl involved by pandering to them.

max: ... maybe; but the desire to help FI is independent of that. they could both be there. however, i don't want to compromise FI in order to promote it, that would be pointless.

anon: ...

max: okay, say we start with my goal, to help FI. what things would help beginners without compromising FI?

anon: maybe you're going a bit fast. helping FI is a broad, nonspecific goal. you have background goals your not listing, and I guess some methods of "helping" might be off limits to you. What do you *actually* want?

max: I want a better world, and a better life for future people. I think it's important to contribute to that if I can. There are ways I do that outside FI, which are fine. But I don't want to just do those other things, I think FI succeeding will be important - both on its own merit, and because my other things will do better too. Or, if my other things don't do better, in the future other people like me might be able to do better than I did. I want humanity to get more good thinkers, and I don't know how that will happen without FI. Slowly I guess.

max: I want other things too, associated stuff.

- it's not about lowering standards to pander, it's about practice

practice stages

- do it at all
- do it repeatedly (lower ER)
- do it fast
