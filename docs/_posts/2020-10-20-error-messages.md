context: I'm thinking about error feedback in general, and I'm also thinking about the sorts of error msgs programmers get in the regular course of programming.

* are error messages a good way to organise issues? (e.g. in software dev).
* they have an important role: they guide ppl who know less (than the developers, or other community members, etc).
* if error msgs were a bad way to organise issues then there must be a better alternative system. what would such a system be like relatively speaking?
    - it would put more burden on the ppl affected by errors b/c it's harder to know/learn how to report and solve the errors
    - it would mean responsibility for the quality of error reporting would be shifted towards the shoulders of newbies
    - such an alternative system would treat the relevant (preventable!) errors less seriously

* why could that be good?
    - it'd mean there was a higher bar for engaging with top tier ppl
    - it filters out ppl who are not able to understand the problem at least enough to figure out how to begin to deal with it
    - if the best ppl don't know how to prevent relevant errors then isn't it better for them to focus on solving those problems rather than helping ppl who aren't as valuable?

* why could it be bad?
    - higher bar to error correction -> less error correction
    - easy to discourage ppl and end up reinforcing static memes / driving ppl away
    - if the best ppl didn't know how to prevent the relevant errors then they end up working on the problem anyway; makes sense that there's an equilibrium here; after all, ppl are voluntarily participating on both sides.

relevant to:
- helping the best ppl or helping the masses
- error msgs and ~responsibility of senior members
- there is no one constant set of behaviours that makes sense WRT helping the best ppl vs masses, what matters is context. is it a good time to help one or the other? if lots of ppl have really bad ideas then it's probably worth helping the best ppl -- so we can find a good soln to that problem. conversely, if we don't have any great ppl at that time, or are otherwise short of *great* opportunities, then there's more utility helping the masses. there needs to be fertiliser for future generations, but also nourishment for current ppl in their prime. those *great* opportunities can be vicarious, ofc. Man's first journey to the Moon was a journey shared by a Nation.
- there's a big question raised by this: how should we react to *learning* of a great opportunity?

Finishing up: what happens if someone goes to an effort to make error msgs as good as possible?
- organisation gets better b/c the error messages are better suited to the associated errors
- it gets easier for ppl to help with / do error correction b/c the msgs/explanations match the contextually best ideas more closely and are more reliable to reason about.
- exponential/geometric increase in effectiveness of relevant key ppl -- their time can be better allocated, delegation gets easier, etc
- mutually beneficial for all parties. (note: this relies on the ability to improve error msgs and the right ~economic context to make it the easy choice. OTH I think that's reasonably common. most non-optimum situations don't hurt much and can be easily controlled via the 2nd-derivative (~acceleration). if there's a bit too much work on good error msgs then you can just reduce the hours per week by 10%; it can be gentle without much harm. the harm I mention here is wasted resources in a generic sense.)

## clarifying stuff

I didn't put a huge amount of thought into particular word choices because they felt difficult and I didn't want to ruin the flow. Here are some clarifications:

- *responsibility* as in *~responsibility of senior members*: i don't mean anything like an obligation, but if there was a clear moral decision then it'd line up with that. 
- *2nd-derivative (~acceleration)*: controlling the rate-of-rate-of-change is useful if you want to control the outcomes of some (simple enough) system, and acceleration is a reasonably common way of talking about that.
