<!-- l. 51 --><p class='noindent'>People propose that proof-of-stake (PoS) can be used to protect blockchains. The
proposition to use proof-of-stake is flawed. The paper looks at the history and
motivation of proof-of-work (PoW) (as used in Bitcoin). PoW ”evades a impossibility
result” [sic]. The paper shows PoS is not a viable replacement.

     <li class='itemize'>You can do this with cryptographic security, instead of physical security.

<!-- l. 78 --><p class='noindent'>Instead of ”this key is worth <span class='tcrm-1000'>$</span>X because that is the cost of it being public”, one can say

<!-- l. 91 --><p class='noindent'>A synchronous network is required. You can’t assume nodes need to agree on precise
timing of events or the order of events. You can’t make that assumption for networks
over the internet anyway.
</p><!-- l. 93 --><p class='indent'>   For blockchains, we just need distributed consensus on the order of transactions (and
nothing else).<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn3x0-bk' href='#fn3x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>3</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5002f3'></a>
That means nodes must agree on the first transaction that moves particular funds.
That means the recipient can trust that the network treats those coins as
his.
</p><!-- l. 95 --><p class='indent'>   The <span class='cmti-10'>double-spending problem </span>is the reason we need distributed consensus.
Someone could always try to send the same money to two different people.
Both transactions could look valid. Recipients need to know that if there
are conflicts about ownership they will still get their money. Distributed
consensus means nodes can agree that the one recorded first is the right
one.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn4x0-bk' href='#fn4x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>4</sup></a></span><a id='x1-5003f4'></a>

<!-- l. 101 --><p class='noindent'>We can prove that distributed consensus cannot be cryptographically guaranteed on an async
network.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn5x0-bk' href='#fn5x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>5</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6001f5'></a>
Bitcoin gets around this by only requiring an economic guarantee. It does this via
external opportunity cost. That opportunity cost is CPU time and electricity. Bitcoin
provides rewards within the system, but only if consensus and an unbroken
transaction history is maintained.
</p><!-- l. 103 --><p class='indent'>   Proofs of work in Bitcoin prove an opportunity cost was paid and how
much it was. Such a proof includes all work (past proofs) up to that
point.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn6x0-bk' href='#fn6x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>6</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6002f6'></a>
Bitcoin nodes choose the history with the most total work as the valid history to
extend. (Though it can be a bit fuzzy at the head if there are multiple options.)
This history is called the consensus history. You can only spend coins on
the consensus history. So miners are incentivised to all work on the same
history.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn7x0-bk' href='#fn7x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>7</sup></a></span><a id='x1-6003f7'></a>

<!-- l. 107 --><p class='noindent'>The big idea behind PoS is to move opportunity cost from outside the system to
inside it. People want to do this because PoW incentivises ppl to do as much work as
possible. Bitcoin work is thermodynamic work. For this kind of work, the
Landauer limit lets us figure out what ”as much work as possible” means. The
result is a network that uses a lot of energy. This drives us towards the heat
death of the universe. It drives us ”literally as fast as the laws of physics will
allow”<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn9x0-bk' href='#fn9x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>9</sup></a></span><a id='x1-7001f9'></a> If
opportunity cost is inside the system we should be able to use fewer resources (and
limit their usage).
</p><!-- l. 109 --><p class='indent'>   PoS works b/c currency holders can lock up their funds (”stake”) in some
staking scheme. This action is cryptographically verifiable. Particular people
publish signed updates to extend the chain’s history. Normally a small random
selection of people are chosen to do this, and only a majority need to agree to
publish an extension. Those people get a reward and can unlock their stake
later.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn10x0-bk' href='#fn10x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>10</sup></a></span><a id='x1-7002f10'></a>
</p><!-- l. 111 --><p class='indent'>   PoS doesn’t depend on the high cost of taking control of the main history (unlike
PoW). Instead, PoS says stakeholders will agree on the extension. They’ll do this b/c:

     <li class='itemize'>they’re randomly chosen so are unlikely to collude, and

     <li class='itemize'>the ”weak synchronicity” is enough to agree on a single history.</li></ul>
<!-- l. 129 --><p class='indent'>   The problem with the argument is
simple.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn12x0-bk' href='#fn12x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>12</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8002f12'></a>
The problem is to do with what ”short interval” means. It’s only short relative to the
full history. The full history (”consensus history”) has to exist for ”short interval” to
mean something. [But the full history is based on stakeholders’ balances.] So we’re
still begging the question. A stakeholder has no incentive to be honest if they sell
their stake (like at an exchange). This means they can’t be punished for forking the
history at the time they had control. They could also expose their private keys and
let others fork the history.
</p><!-- l. 139 --><p class='indent'>   This is difficult to understand.<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn13x0-bk' href='#fn13x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>13</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8003f13'></a>
We can use an example. Suppose that earlier, a single person could add blocks.  <a id='ex10'></a>It
might have happened naturally, if the keys were chosen by some algorithm,
or it could happen if the person got other private keys (maybe by buying
them).<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn14x0-bk' href='#fn14x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>14</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8004f14'></a>
The person getting all the relevant keys can happen much later, and keyholders
aren’t incentivised to keep their keys secret after they use them. Keyholders also
might accidentally reveal their keys, and the chance of that increases over
time.
</p><!-- l. 146 --><p class='indent'>   Now we have an attacker who can fork the chain at an earlier point in
time. To replace the consensus history the attacker needs to make an
alternate history, starting from his fork, and this new history needs to be
longer<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn15x0-bk' href='#fn15x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>15</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8005f15'></a> than the existing public
history. But every block<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn16x0-bk' href='#fn16x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>16</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8006f16'></a>
needs new signers. Can the attacker still do the attack? Yes: we used
the word ”random” but the network needs to agree on the new signers
(otherwise we’d get lots of forks), so the new selection has to be based on
past history. That means an attacker with enough past signing keys can
change<span class='footnote-mark'><a id='fn17x0-bk' href='#fn17x0'><sup class='textsuperscript'>17</sup></a></span><a id='x1-8007f17'></a>
the history they control so that their keys are always selected for the next
part. (The attacker probably needs to try lots of different options to find
a way to continue the consensus history so he keeps control. It’s like the
attacker replaced proof-of-stake with proof-of-work but centralised around
themselves.)
</p><!-- l. 148 --><p class='indent'>   This ability to control future selections of stakeholders (and maybe even the <span class='cmti-10'>set</span>
they’re chosen from) is bad. It’s bad – even if no one is trying to attack the network –
because the signers who extend history have an incentive to choose futures better for
them, so the system will get centralised. They can do this by manipulating future
selection processes, or blocking transactions that would introduce potential new
signers.

<!-- l. 152 --><p class='noindent'>Intuitively, no, but there’s no rigorous argument.

If there’s (virtually) no cost for signers to make blocks, they can easily search for
blocks with a better future for them. Regardless of the safeguards to prevent
minority-rule, an attacker can influence the consensus history towards a future we’re
they’re the majority, even if they’re the only physical party (they might have lots of
keys).
</p><!-- l. 157 --><p class='indent'>   It appears that whatever ”space” we want distributed consensus in, we need
opportunity cost in that space. (For Bitcoin, it’s the ”space of humans”, which is
roughly thermodynamic space, since we’re agents in that space.)
