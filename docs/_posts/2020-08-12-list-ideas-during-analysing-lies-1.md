- why would it be important to be impressive but to not aim to be impressive?

- analysing lies redux
  - explanation + bg on what I've watched
  - plan: X hrs a day, do both analysis then comparisons

- log my unfinished topics - finish them

- reflections on learning FI
  - challenge notion of self
  - can't predict problems or pace; if it wasn't surprising/confronting/causing idea-conflicts you wouldn't be learning
    - what topics could work well to help ppl getting in to FI
    - write posts (as exercises) about fallibleideas.github.io

- add list of unresolved conflicts and track them - get them resolved (tutorial 26 examples; learning and errors; another one...)

- how can you go about learning?

- how can you actually be impressive instead of looking impressive?

- what's the difference between debating as a debater, and debating as a thinker?

- reconsider instantaneous goals
  - i.e. instantaneous priorities
    - change "why did I write this?" to "why should I write this?"

- practice writing digests of what I learn; post those to site, maybe weekly update to FI?

- write post about writing style and how it can be dishonest; simpler is better
  - here's an old example: XXXXX (e.g. IBDD popper's criterion)
  - speaking simply makes hiding lies harder.
  - speaker can't put in the same sort of social signals. it's harder to tell people what to think with simple language.
  - simple language is also easier to read and understand. if you can write complex ideas in simple language, that's a virtue. it makes it easier to spread good ideas, and it makes the writing more enduring.
  - (from AnalyzingLies1; ET) 32:07 where you're supposed to use bold and simple writing. and make your stuff easy to criticise. (not fancy and confusing)

- thoughts on quoting people like goldratt: status, context, synchronicity
  - context, post about "intellectual response time doens't matter; a novel interpretation of the tortise and the hare as a metaphor for attitudes towards thinking and learning.
    - quote goldratt: "I'm a bodybuilder"

- how to symbols and our ideas about our self interact?

- why would rules like always saying "i think" before sentences mean when explaining an idea?
  - meaningless, it's sort of implied anyway
  - but also not saying it is (at least sometimes) explicitly removing the "it's just my opinion" excuse - you're making a claim about reality by doing that, and reality doesn't care about your opinion.
  - so to refuse to *not* add "i think" means (at least in part) that you're refusing to take "it's just my opinion" off the table as a means to end the discussion irrationally. why would someone do that? well one reason is because they want the excuse there b/c they know they'll need it.

- how would grouping symbols change written english? (if we integrated something with a function like parens in maths / programming)

- have a script / flow chart for resolving paths forward style stuff (where the other person has different ideas). you can add stuff like "do I spot a problem with meta / social stuff? yes -> raise that I have a problem, ask if they have methodology to resolve such issues. do they? no -> paths forward, yes -> try that. did it work? no -> paths forward, yes -> leart a new way to resolve conflicts maybe, maybe resolved by luck, either way you can move on and maybe take extra ideas w/ you (okay it's a long shot).
  - you can also say to the person (btw I have a methodology for asking about methodolgies, it's here if you want to check it out or skip ahead)
  - if the person looks at the flow chart and can move to the bit that's appropriate then it saves dialog time

- don't tell a story ("i was reading blah and thought blah"), tell the idea ("what if blah causes blah? I think it could because blah. Here's an example: blah")

### August 13th

- what is fallible ideas?
  - community + living tradition of critical fallibilism

- what is the relationship between critical rationalism and critical fallibilism. What are some differences?
  - important disagreements exist

- thoughts on conflict between learning and error rate
  - doing time limited challenges increases error rate but can be useful for learning quickly
    - what's going on here?
  - the more I learn the more intuitive it is to me that [*powering-up*](https://www.elliottemple.com/essays/life-overreaching-correcting-error) is a priority.

- why would wanting to be remembered as someone who contributed to a good future be good?
  
- why would wanting to be remembered as someone who contributed to a good future be second handed?

- why would wanting to be remembered as someone who contributed to a good future be bad?

- AL1: the prioritization of *academic* politicking indicates Birner thinks success as a philosopher depends on success in academia, which is wrong.

- AL1: it's curious how much i read into both the title and the ellipsis. if they were put there by the guy who posted (need to check source) it shows how much i take good quoting for granted. if it wasn't CR i think i would have been more sceptical of the quoting quality.

- why did overreaching stuff / coming to terms with own problems feel *~confessional* before but doesn't now?

- songs to analyse
  - santa clause is coming to town (TCS / lying to children)
  - call me maybe
  - you need to calm down (taylor swift)
  - blank space (taylor swift)
  - sk8er boi

- standard nomenclature for FI posts about flagging stuff you
- overreaching - label for full post
- social signal / social dynamics / static meme - for particular statements or sentences; jokes, all jokes?
  - not all jokes; e.g. "a preposition is fine to end a sentence with"
- self grading of quality
