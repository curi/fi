[OP on curi.us](http://curi.us/2380#18560)

Unendorsing ~everything would basically mean that I say: from some date (eg 3rd Nov 2020) it's not safe to assume I endorse/believe/etc anything I said publicly before that date.

It'd be like a reset on things. Partially that's b/c there are a lot of unresolved things (e.g. the FI discussion on Flux from 2017) which I think are not worth resolving from that point. There are also things I've said that I don't want to go back and try to change b/c that sounds like a lot of work. I don't have high enough confidence in what I've said to want to leave stuff about without knowing what it was.

I'd make a post on my blogs but wouldn't go to much effort outside that now. I'd point ppl to those posts when necessary and then address stuff on a case by case basis to update stuff I've said publicly.

I think this sounds like a fair thing for someone to do very infrequently, maybe only once.

I think this would be a good thing to do because I think my ideas and my self have changed substantially in the past few years and especially the past few months.

I also think that, from this point out, keeping things mostly up to date (or at least updatable) is something I could do. So doing a mass unendorsing would let me keep a higher quality library of criticism.

A mass unendorsing would also be a decent start to a library of criticism; it indicates a relevant discontinuity and means the stuff I write after that has special considerations the earlier stuff lacked.

If I intend to only do this once then I should treat it fairly seriously.

I'm looking for feedback.
