  * 32
    * built a tree of TAG discussion on LW
  * 33
    * method of discussion: each answer 1 question and pose 1 q each reply. Note to self: use this in future.
    * finished [Reading: Distributed Consensus from Proof of Stake is Impossible](../2020-08-28-reading-distributed-consensus-pos-impossible)

* I started "haskell from first principles" again - reviewed material I'd already covered.

misc:

carry-over things I wasn't happen about:

* ~~I haven't done any writing practice this week~~. I did some, though not much.
* I haven't read more of *The Choice*. Still haven't.
* Didn't do much on the weekend.
* Not using time efficiently -- feels like at least.
