fabric notes

ch1

* "crucial experimental test"
  * conflict between explanations
* fabric p17 - Theory of everything is a new *start*, not an end.
* p18, unification and shift underway (towards ToE)
  * did DD still believe this when writing BoI
* I predict (low confidence) AGI will be the unification of evolution+epistemology
  * particularly something equiv to finding genes in bio evolution
* sensation vs shadow sensation - qualia real regardless of universe?
* "privileged position" wrt explanation

ch 2

* light bends only in 2 circumstances?
  * via curved space (GR) **todo** check if DD says light bends under GR
  * via interference (e.g. double slit)
  * ET: refraction/reflection
* past q: does light ever interfere with other light or only with itself?
  * thought from BoI: happens when photons become fungible (the same photon or others)
  * fabric says no? 19:50
    * i.e. photons only interfere with themselves?
    * confirmed 36:10
* offtopic - FoR ch2,25:00 maybe -- beginning to talk about "tangible" photons and what it means to be in the same universe -> thinking about the "what to do with way out there ideas" post
  a. maybe this section answers the q "what do you think a universe is?
