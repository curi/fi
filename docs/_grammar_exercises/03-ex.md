## After lunch, after John sings, he loves playing games.

```
(after2 :: subordinating conjunction
    (sings :: verb
        John :: noun
    )
    (loves :: verb
        (after1 :: preposition
            lunch :: noun)
        he :: pronoun
        (playing :: verbal.gerund.noun -- verbal, acts like a noun, has an object
            games :: noun
        )
    )
)
```

## I want to learn lots of interesting grammar.

```
(want :: verb
    I :: noun
    ((to learn) :: verbal.infinitive.noun
        (lots :: noun
            (of :: preposition
                (grammar :: noun
                    interesting :: verbal.participle.adjective
                    )))
    ))
    
    -- moved this ndoe to be a child of to learn
    -- lots :: ~adverb~ no b/c we couldn't put 'very' in there, for example
```

## Running fast isn’t fun.

```
(is :: verb
    not :: mod
    (running :: verbal.gerund.noun
        fast :: noun
    )
    fun :: noun
)
```

## I don’t want to stand on my porch when it’s wet.

attempt 1:

```
(when :: conj,subordinating
    (do :: verb
        I :: noun
        (want :: noun
            (to stand) :: infinitive noun
                (on (porch my)) :: prepositional phrase, adj))
    (is
        it
        wet)
)
```

prepositional phrases are a type of modifier



## Swimming after work is too tiring.

```
(is :: v
    (swimming :: n
        (after work) :: pp,adj
    )
    (tiring :: n
        too :: adj) :: complement
)
```

## John gets sweaty when he does his exercise routine.

```
(when :: subordinate conj
    (gets :: v
        John :: n
        sweaty :: adj)
    (does
        he :: pronoun
        (routine :: n
            exercise :: adj  -- no dictionary def for adj
            his :: det)
    )
)
```

## I gave him gifts.

-> I gave gifts to him

```
(gave :: verb
    I
    gifts
    (to him) :: prepositional phrase, adverb
    )
```

* <https://groups.google.com/g/fallible-ideas/c/nIJNYVJ7tNs/m/LvuiKkkYAwAJ> (agrees)

## I love to throw boomerangs to myself.

```
(love :: v
    I :: pronoun
    ((to throw) :: noun infinitive
        boomerangs :: noun, object of (to throw)
        (to :: preposition
            myself :: noun) :: PP,adverb
)
```

working: I could say: `I will throw boomerangs to myself` - throw is verb, will is adverb, boomerangs is noun, (to myself) is modifying 'throw'?

## When a movie is boring, I stop watching.

```
(when :: conj, subordinating  -- could be an adverb? but how to structure tree?
    (stop :: v
        I :: n
        watching :: n,gerund
    )
    (is :: v
        (movie :: n
            a :: det)
        boring :: adj
        )
)
```

## I like reading non-fiction books out of order.

```
(like :: verb
    I :: pronoun
    (reading :: gerund
        (books :: n
            non-fiction :: adj) :: object
        (of :: prep
            (order :: n
                out :: adj)
        ) :: adj prepositional phrase
    ) :: NP
)
```

* note: disagrees with JM's analysis
* <https://groups.google.com/g/fallible-ideas/c/lHhbJdfTrx0/m/EB6oknUWDgAJ> - ambiguity around "out", easiest thing to do is treat "out of" as a single preposition. seems to me that this is compatible w/ the above, and that if you expand like that then "out" is either an adj or adverb depending on the sentence (e.g. I ran out the door -> I ran out of the door -> 'out' modifies the running)

## My broken speakers don’t work for making sound.

```
(work :: v
    (speakers :: n
        broken :: adj
        my :: det)
    not :: adverb
    do :: aux verb
    (for :: preposition
        (making :: gerund
            sound :: object of making))
)
```

## FYI, working at the CIA is cooler than [working at] the FBI.

```
(is :: verb
    (working :: gerund
        (at :: preposition
            (CIA :: ref,noun
                the :: det)))
    (cooler :: adj <CIA and FBI are objects>
        (than :: preposition
            ([working]
                ([at]
                    (FBI :: reference - noun
                        the :: det))))
                )
    (FYI :: reference - prepositional phrase)
)
```
