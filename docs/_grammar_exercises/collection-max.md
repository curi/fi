## He was waiting for the rain to stop.

```
was :: verb
    he :: pronoun
    waiting :: gerund
        for :: preposition
            to stop :: infinitive
                rain :: noun
                    the :: det
                :: subject
```

* 'to stop' - could be (preposition,noun) but a noun would mean something like 'a stop' could be put in there, doesn't feel right => infinitive makes more sense

## Nobody's ever been bothered by being dead.

implied => Nobody [has] ever been bothered by being dead

```
bothered :: verb, linking
    has :: aux verb
        been :: aux verb
        ever :: adverb
    :: adverbial
    nobody :: pronoun
    by :: preposition
        being :: gerund
            dead :: adjective / object of 'being'
    :: adverbial
```

* 'ever' adverb on 'has' 
  * -> usage: can remove 'ever', 'has ever', but not just 'has'
  * -> 'ever been to the moon?' -> implied 'have you'

bothered as root
nobody under bothered

* bothered becomes a linking verb bc

relative pronoun -> clause function as modifier 

## The main difference between object and complement in English grammar is that the object is what is affected to the action of the subject while the complement is a part of a clause that usually follows the verb and adds more information about the subject or object.

I found this on a grammar website.

{<[difference] between [x and y]>} is that {[x is [what is [affected to [action of [subject]]]]]} while {[y is [a part of [a clause that [usually follows the verb]]] that [follows the verb] and [adds info about [subject]]]}.

## (TODO) I know about it (Objectivism) in name only (and only since learning about FI, and because of FI)

Note: I can definitely write this better (it's from [early learning: objectivism]({{ "../../pub-drafts/early-learning-objectivism.md" | relative_url }})). Left it like this for purposes of analysis, partly because I said 'and because'

## I can explain.

(added after doing the one below)

```
can :: aux verb
    explain :: verb
    i :: pronoun
```

## I can explain the acronyms if need be.

```
if :: conjunction
    can :: verb
        i :: pronoun
        explain :: infinitive
            acronyms :: noun (object)
                the :: det
    be :: verb
        need :: noun

## It is a poor argument of my superior reason, that I am unable to make justice be apprehended and felt in the most necessary cases, without the intervention of blows.

'It' refers to 'that'. 'that' is a fwd reference for 'I am unable to make justice be apprehended and felt in the most necessary cases, without the intervention of blows'.

Could be reordered to: 'That I am unable to make justice be apprehended and felt in the most necessary cases, without the intervention of blows, is a poor argument of my superior reason.'  (note: unsure of commas, making 'without the intervention of blows' parenthetical feels right; alternatively no comma before 'without' might work too)

[It (X)] is a [bad argument] of [my ability to make good arguments]. X: [I can't do justice when necessary without violence]

The sentence is interesting because it's about a hypothetical but doesn't explicitly mention it.

### alt structure 1

```
that :: subordinating conjunction
    is :: verb
        it :: pronoun, referring to the subordinate clause
        argument :: noun
            a :: det
            poor :: adj
            of :: prep
                reason :: noun
                    my :: det
                    superior :: adj
    am :: verb
        I :: pronoun
        unable :: adj
            to make :: adverb infinitive
                justice :: noun
                be :: aux verb
                    and :: conj
                        apprehended :: verb
                        felt :: verb
                without :: prep
                    intervention :: noun
                        the :: det
                        of :: prep
                            blows :: noun
```

note: ~it's optional to put a `[be]` in front of `felt`, but apprehended needs one.~ not true, justice could be felt and apprehended. well, could you say `make justice felt and apprehended`? `make justice felt` feels fine.

from <https://www.websters1913.com/words/That>

> 4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: --
>
> (a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the preceding verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb.

for (a): it is introducing a clause which is the subject of a preceding verb via 'it'

idea for omission: "... superior reason, [the fact] that I ..."

'that' could be modifying 'argument'

the form of the sentence is `{dependent coordinating clause}, that {subordinate clause}`

the purpose of the sentence is to focus on the _quality of the argument_, not on what it is.

I *think* `I am unable ... of blows` is the predicate nominative of `It` via `is`

### similar sort of sentences

> you'd be a bad king, Michael

`You` is a pronoun and forward reference to the noun `Michael`

----

> it is a smooth bird, the A380.

----

> it is a bad omen for his career, that he hasn't had a job since highschool.

`it` refers to the subordinate clause `he hasn't had a job since highschool`

----

> it is a thought I had, that school is boring

this has basically the same meaning (or, at least, a very similar meaning) as the past tense of "i think that school is boring". (edit: `i thought that school is boring` is obviously closer to that past tense)

some curious slightly different sentences:

* `it is a thought I'd had, that school was boring`
* `it is a thought I'd have, that school was boring`
* `it is a thought I had had, that school was boring`
* `I'd had the thought that school is boring`
* `I'd have had the thought that school is boring` (q: is this grammatically complete?)
* `school is boring; I'd've had that thought`

version that's a better demonstration?

> it is a thought shared by many, that school is boring

----

> it is a versatile word, that which clarifies the dependency of a pronoun on the other side of the sentence.

### back to the main sentence

~At the end of all that, I think I'm happy with the tree above.~ wait, nope, not yet

is the structure basically the same as `it's good, that you came`?

TODO: come back to this later and think about other ways of doing the tree

hmm, the quote is from Godwin's *Political Justice* I think (can't remember where I picked it). that was published in 1793, but websters 1828 doesn't have a definition of `that` as a conjunction!

### alternate structure 2

idea: `that` is two-way link with `it`

```
is
    it :: pronoun relative pronoun (linked to 'that')
        that :: relative pronoun / pro-sentence (linked to 'it')
            am :: verb
                I :: pronoun
                unable :: adj
                    to make :: adverb infinitive
                        justice :: noun
                        be :: aux verb
                            and :: conj
                                apprehended :: adj
                                felt :: verb
                        without :: prep
                            intervention :: noun
                                the :: det

    argument :: noun
        a :: det
        poor :: adj
        of :: prep
            reason :: noun
                my :: det
                superior :: adj
```

### alt structure 3

                                blows :: noun
```

### issues identified in tutoring 20

`apprehended` and `felt` are verbals

```
to make :: infinitive
    be :: linking verb
        justice :: n
        and
            apprehended :: participle, adj
            felt :: participle, adj
```

note: `to` is a particle

`be` is linking verb, objects are apprehended and felt so can't be finite verbs, they're participles (adjectives)

linking verbs: big diff *must* have a complement, and complement can be an adjective (as well as a noun).

### tut 20

parenthetical can put under the verb -> modifies the sentence

have is infinitive -- the 'having' isn't happening; it's the 'woulding'

pretty much alwasy the first verb is finite verb, second verb is infinitive (often without the 'to')

subject finite-verb non-finite-verb (as object of finite verb; particle, gerund, or infinitive)

> TUT20: mistake: fight/run as verb - must be verbals -- participles

> TUT20: comment after the fact: can put `you` under `or`; `or` is making a group and playing a verb role (verb pharse), so noun under the group is okay. If we could group `(or fight run)` and have a child that might work but can't do that with these trees; putting under root node
