### He left the scene of the accident and tried to forget that it had happened.

1 | He left the scene of the accident, and tried to forget that it had happened.

> Note: I checked the answers after this first attempt. Rule 1 is:
> > Use commas to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of these seven coordinating conjunctions: *and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet*.
> I googled 'independent clauses' and it sounds like the inverse is a subordinate clause. My initial thought about it was the 'it' is a back reference, so not independent.
> next thing I found:
> > An independent clause is a clause that can stand alone as a sentence (i.e., it expresses a complete thought). A dependent clauses (or subordinate clause) is one that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence (i.e., it does not express a complete thought).
> the 2nd clause has an implied `he` if nothing else: `... and [he] tried to forget that it happened.`
> so a clause is independent only when a) has a backref and/or b) implied words from the previous clause.
> those two sound like we could just say 'has a grammatical dependency of any kind on the previous clause'.
